HyperFrames is an open-source framework for turning HTML, CSS, media, and seekable animations into deterministic MP4 videos. Use it locally with the CLI, from AI coding agents with skills, or as the rendering core behind hosted authoring workflows.

## Quick Start

### With an AI coding agent

Install the HyperFrames skills, then describe the video you want:

```bash
npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes
```

> The picker opens with nothing pre-selected — the **Core Skills** group is all you need: the `/hyperframes` router installs each creation workflow on demand. Agents and non-interactive runs should use `npx hyperframes skills update` instead — it installs exactly the core set, whereas a non-interactive `skills add` without `--skill` installs all 20.
>
> `skills add` resolves the skills.sh registry blob, which can lag `main` by hours. `npx hyperframes skills update` installs from the current `main`, so reach for it when you need the newest copy of a skill.

Try a prompt like:

> Using `/hyperframes`, create a 10-second product intro with a fade-in title, a background video, and subtle background music.

The skills teach agents the HyperFrames production loop: plan the video, write valid HTML, wire seekable animations, add media, lint, preview, and render. They work with Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Codex, and other coding agents that support skills.

## Skills

HyperFrames ships 20 skills agents load on demand. Read `/hyperframes` first — it's the router and capability map; it picks a workflow for any "make me a…" request — video, deck, or composition port — and points to the domain skills below.

Default to the **core set** — the router installs each creation workflow on demand. `npx hyperframes skills update` installs exactly that from anywhere; the interactive picker (`npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes`) lists it as the "Core Skills" group, nothing pre-selected. The picker is interactive-only — a non-interactive or agent run without `--skill` installs all 20. Use `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --all` to install all 20 deliberately (skips the picker), or `npx skills add heygen-com/hyperframes --skill <name>` for just one (bare name, no leading `/`).

Installs stay lean after that: `npx hyperframes init` keeps the **core set** fresh (the router, the `hyperframes-*` domain skills, and `media-use` — plus whatever is already installed; `/figma` stays on demand) and never expands a partial install; the creation workflows install **on demand** — the router runs `npx hyperframes skills update <workflow>` before entering one. Nothing re-pulls the full set behind your back.

### Upload to Codex

Build the upload-ready Codex plugin archive from the committed `HEAD` version of the manifest, brand assets, and skills:

```bash
bun run package:codex-plugin
```

This writes `dist/hyperframes-plugin.zip` with a `hyperframes/` root folder and fails if the archive exceeds Codex's 100 MB upload limit.

### Router

| Skill          | Use when                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `/hyperframes` | **Read first** for any request to make / create / edit / animate / render a video, animation, or motion graphic. Capability map for the domain skills, the intent layer that confirms every creation brief up front, and intent router for the creation workflows below. |

### Creation workflows

| Skill                      | Use when                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/product-launch-video`    | Any **website** — marketing / launching / promoting a product (from its URL, a brief, or a script), or a site tour / showcase / social clip featuring the site's own visuals. Up to ~3 min (sweet spot 30-90s).              |
| `/faceless-explainer`      | **Explaining a topic / concept** from arbitrary text — no product, no URL, no website capture; every visual is LLM-invented (typography / abstract / diagram / data-viz).                                                    |
| `/pr-to-video`             | A **GitHub pull request** (PR URL, `owner/repo#N` ref, or "this PR") → changelog / feature-reveal / fix / refactor explainer, read via the `gh` CLI.                                                                         |
| `/embedded-captions`       | Adding **captions / subtitles** to an existing talking-head video (footage untouched) — verbatim rail, embedded climax behind the subject, or pure-cinematic embed.                                                          |
| `/talking-head-recut`      | Packaging an existing talking-head / interview / podcast video with **designed graphic overlays** — lower-thirds, data callouts, kinetic titles, pull-quotes, side panels, PiP.                                              |
| `/motion-graphics`         | A short, **unnarrated, design-led motion graphic** (~under 10s) — kinetic type, stat / chart hit, logo sting, lower-third, animated tweet / headline. MP4 or transparent overlay.                                            |
| `/music-to-video`          | A **music track** (audio file, video to pull audio from, or one generated from a mood brief) → a **beat-synced** video — lyric, slideshow, or kinetic promo; music drives pacing.                                            |
| `/slideshow`               | A **presentation / pitch deck / interactive deck** — discrete slides, fragment reveals, branching, hotspot navigation, presenter mode. Output is a navigable deck, not a rendered video.                                     |
| `/general-video`           | **Anything else** — longer or multi-scene pieces, brand / sizzle reel, title card, static loop, freeform composition. Input- and length-agnostic fallback, and the home of companion mode (co-create with the full toolbox). |
| `/remotion-to-hyperframes` | **Porting an existing Remotion** (React) composition's source to HyperFrames HTML. One-way migration, not creation.                                                                                                          |

### Domain skills (loaded on demand)

Atomic capabilities the creation workflows compose against — pull one when you need that specific layer.

Sourcing the audio is `/media-use`. |
| `/hyperframes-registry`  | Install and wire registry blocks and components into compositions via `hyperframes add`.
