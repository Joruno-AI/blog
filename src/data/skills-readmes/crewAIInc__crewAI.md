## Build with AI

Using an AI coding agent? Teach it CrewAI best practices in one command:

**Claude Code:**
```shell
/plugin marketplace add crewAIInc/skills
/plugin install crewai-skills@crewai-plugins
/reload-plugins
```
Four skills that activate automatically when you ask relevant CrewAI questions:

| Skill | When it runs |
|-------|--------------|
| `getting-started` | Scaffolding new projects, choosing between `LLM.call()` / `Agent` / `Crew` / `Flow`, wiring `crew.jsonc` / `main.py` |
| `design-agent` | Configuring agents — role, goal, backstory, tools, LLMs, memory, guardrails |
| `design-task` | Writing task descriptions, dependencies, structured output (`output_pydantic`, `output_json`), human review |
| `ask-docs` | Querying the live [CrewAI docs MCP server](https://docs.crewai.com/mcp) for up-to-date API details |

**Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and others ([skills.sh](https://skills.sh/crewaiinc/skills)):**
```shell
npx skills add crewaiinc/skills
```

This installs the official [CrewAI Skills](https://github.com/crewAIInc/skills) — structured instructions that teach coding agents how to scaffold Flows, configure Crews, design agents and tasks, and follow CrewAI patterns.

## Getting Started

Setup and run your first CrewAI agents by following this tutorial.

[![CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/-kSOTtYzgEw/hqdefault.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-kSOTtYzgEw "CrewAI Getting Started Tutorial")

### Learning Resources

Learn CrewAI through our comprehensive courses:

- [Multi AI Agent Systems with CrewAI](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/multi-ai-agent-systems-with-crewai/) - Master the fundamentals of multi-agent systems
- [Practical Multi AI Agents and Advanced Use Cases](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/practical-multi-ai-agents-and-advanced-use-cases-with-crewai/) - Deep dive into advanced implementations

### Understanding Flows and Crews

CrewAI offers two powerful, complementary approaches that work seamlessly together to build sophisticated AI applications:

1. **Crews**: Teams of AI agents with true autonomy and agency, working together to accomplish complex tasks through role-based collaboration. Crews enable:

   - Natural, autonomous decision-making between agents
   - Dynamic task delegation and collaboration
   - Specialized roles with defined goals and expertise
   - Flexible problem-solving approaches

2. **Flows**: Production-ready, event-driven workflows that deliver precise control over complex automations. Flows provide:

   - Fine-grained control over execution paths for real-world scenarios
   - Secure, consistent state management between tasks
   - Clean integration of AI agents with production Python code
   - Conditional branching for complex business logic

The true power of CrewAI emerges when combining Crews and Flows. This synergy allows you to:

- Build complex, production-grade applications
- Balance autonomy with precise control
- Handle sophisticated real-world scenarios
- Maintain clean, maintainable code structure

### Getting Started with Installation

To get started with CrewAI, follow these simple steps. The full walkthrough lives in the [installation guide](https://docs.crewai.com/en/installation).

### 1. Installation

CrewAI requires `Python >=3.10 and <3.14`. Check your version with:

```bash
python3 --version
```

CrewAI uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling. If you haven't installed `uv` yet, install it first.

**macOS/Linux:**

```shell
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

If your system doesn't have `curl`, you can use `wget`:

```shell
wget -qO- https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**

```shell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

If you run into any issues, refer to [UV's installation guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Then install the CrewAI CLI:

```shell
uv tool install crewai
```

If you encounter a `PATH` warning, run:

```shell
uv tool update-shell
```

If you encounter the `chroma-hnswlib==0.7.6` build error (`fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'float.h'`) on Windows, install [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) with *Desktop development with C++*.

Verify the install:

```shell
uv tool list
```

You should see something like:

```shell
crewai v0.102.0
- crewai
```

To upgrade the global CLI later:

```shell
uv tool install crewai --upgrade
```

This upgrades the **global `crewai` CLI tool** only. To upgrade the `crewai` version inside a project's virtual environment, see [Upgrading CrewAI in a project](https://docs.crewai.com/en/guides/migration/upgrading-crewai).

### 2. Setting Up Your Crew

`crewai create crew` creates a JSON-first crew project. Agents live in `agents/*.jsonc`, tasks and crew-level settings live in `crew.jsonc`, and `crewai run` loads that JSON definition directly.

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name>
```

This command creates a new project folder with the following structure:

```
my_project/
├── .gitignore
├── .env
├── agents/
│   └── researcher.jsonc
├── crew.jsonc
├── knowledge/
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── skills/
└── tools/
```

If you need the older Python/YAML scaffold with `crew.py`, `config/agents.yaml`, and `config/tasks.yaml`, run:

```shell
crewai create crew <project_name> --classic
```

See [Using Annotations](https://docs.crewai.com/en/learn/using-annotations) for the classic pattern.

#### To customize your project, you can:

- Modify `agents/*.jsonc` to define each agent's role, goal, backstory, LLM, tools, and behavior.
- Modify `crew.jsonc` to define tasks, process, and input defaults.
- Add custom tools in `tools/` and reference them as `"custom:<name>"`.
- Add optional knowledge files in `knowledge/` and skill files in `skills/`.
- Add your environment variables into the `.env` file.

Use `{placeholder}` values in agent and task text, then set defaults in `crew.jsonc` under `inputs`. When you run `crewai run`, the CLI prompts for any missing values.

#### Example of a simple crew with a sequential process:

```shell
crewai create crew latest-ai-development
cd latest_ai_development
```

Then edit the generated files:

**agents/researcher.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "role": "{topic} Senior Data Researcher",
  "goal": "Uncover cutting-edge developments in {topic}",
  "backstory": "You're a seasoned researcher who finds relevant information and presents it clearly.",
  "llm": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "tools": ["SerperDevTool"],
  "settings": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**agents/reporting_analyst.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "role": "{topic} Reporting Analyst",
  "goal": "Create detailed reports based on {topic} data analysis and research findings",
  "backstory": "You're a meticulous analyst who turns complex data into clear, concise reports.",
  "llm": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "settings": {
    "verbose": true
  }
}
```

**crew.jsonc**

```jsonc
{
  "name": "Latest AI Development",
  "agents": ["researcher", "reporting_analyst"],
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "research_task",
      "description": "Conduct thorough research about {topic}. Find recent, relevant information.",
      "expected_output": "A list with 10 bullet points of the most relevant information about {topic}.",
      "agent": "researcher"
    },
    {
      "name": "reporting_task",
      "description": "Review the research and expand each topic into a full section for a report.",
      "expected_output": "A markdown report with the main topics, each with a full section of information. No fenced code blocks around the whole document.",
      "agent": "reporting_analyst",
      "context": ["research_task"],
      "output_file": "output/report.md",
      "markdown": true
    }
  ],
  "process": "sequential",
  "verbose": true,
  "inputs": {
    "topic": "AI Agents"
  }
}
```

### 3. Running Your Crew

Before running your crew, set the required keys in your `.env` file:

- Your model provider API key — see [LLM setup](https://docs.crewai.com/en/concepts/llms#setting-up-your-llm)
- A [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) API key if you use web search: `SERPER_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY_HERE`

Then install dependencies and run from the project directory:

```shell
crewai install
crewai run
```

If you need additional packages, use `uv add <package-name>`.

You should see the output in the console, and `output/report.md` should be created in the project root.

In addition to the sequential process, you can use the hierarchical process, which automatically assigns a manager to the defined crew to properly coordinate the planning and executi
