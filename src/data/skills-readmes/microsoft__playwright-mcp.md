## Playwright MCP

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides browser automation capabilities using [Playwright](https://playwright.dev). This server enables LLMs to interact with web pages through structured accessibility snapshots, bypassing the need for screenshots or visually-tuned models.

### Playwright MCP vs Playwright CLI

This package provides MCP interface into Playwright. If you are using a **coding agent**, you might benefit from using the [CLI+SKILLS](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli) instead.

- **CLI**: Modern **coding agents** increasingly favor CLI–based workflows exposed as SKILLs over MCP because CLI invocations are more token-efficient: they avoid loading large tool schemas and verbose accessibility trees into the model context, allowing agents to act through concise, purpose-built commands. This makes CLI + SKILLs better suited for high-throughput coding agents that must balance browser automation with large codebases, tests, and reasoning within limited context windows.<br>**Learn more about [Playwright CLI with SKILLS](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-cli)**.

- **MCP**: MCP remains relevant for specialized agentic loops that benefit from persistent state, rich introspection, and iterative reasoning over page structure, such as exploratory automation, self-healing tests, or long-running autonomous workflows where maintaining continuous browser context outweighs token cost concerns.

### Key Features

- **Fast and lightweight**. Uses Playwright's accessibility tree, not pixel-based input.
- **LLM-friendly**. No vision models needed, operates purely on structured data.
- **Deterministic tool application**. Avoids ambiguity common with screenshot-based approaches.

### Requirements
- Node.js 18 or newer
- VS Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, Goose, Grok, Junie or any other MCP client

<!--
// Generate using:
node utils/generate-links.js
-->

### Getting started

First, install the Playwright MCP server with your client.

**Standard config** works in most of the tools:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Configuration

Playwright MCP server supports following arguments. They can be provided in the JSON configuration above, as a part of the `"args"` list:

<!--- Options generated by update-readme.js -->

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| --allowed-hosts <hosts...> | comma-separated list of hosts this server is allowed to serve from. Defaults to the host the server is bound to. Pass '*' to disable the host check.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` |
| --allowed-origins <origins> | semicolon-separated list of TRUSTED origins to allow the browser to request. Default is to allow all. Important: *does not* serve as a security boundary and *does not* affect redirects.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` |
| --allow-unrestricted-file-access | allow access to files outside of the workspace roots. Also allows unrestricted access to file:// URLs. By default access to file system is restricted to workspace root directories (or cwd if no roots are configured) only, and navigation to file:// URLs is blocked.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_ALLOW_UNRESTRICTED_FILE_ACCESS` |
| --blocked-origins <origins> | semicolon-separated list of origins to block the browser from requesting. Blocklist is evaluated before allowlist. If used without the allowlist, requests not matching the blocklist are still allowed. Important: *does not* serve as a security boundary and *does not* affect redirects.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BLOCKED_ORIGINS` |
| --block-service-workers | block service workers<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BLOCK_SERVICE_WORKERS` |
| --browser <browser> | browser or chrome channel to use, possible values: chrome, firefox, webkit, msedge.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_BROWSER` |
| --caps <caps> | comma-separated list of additional capabilities to enable, possible values: vision, pdf, devtools.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CAPS` |
| --cdp-endpoint <endpoint> | CDP endpoint to connect to.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CDP_ENDPOINT` |
| --cdp-header <headers...> | CDP headers to send with the connect request, multiple can be specified.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CDP_HEADERS` |
| --cdp-timeout <timeout> | timeout in milliseconds for connecting to CDP endpoint, defaults to 30000ms<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CDP_TIMEOUT` |
| --codegen <lang> | specify the language to use for code generation, possible values: "typescript", "python", "java", "csharp", "none". Default is "typescript".<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CODEGEN` |
| --config <path> | path to the configuration file.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONFIG` |
| --console-level <level> | level of console messages to return: "error", "warning", "info", "debug". Each level includes the messages of more severe levels.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_CONSOLE_LEVEL` |
| --device <device> | device to emulate, for example: "iPhone 15"<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_DEVICE` |
| --mobile | emulate a generic mobile device (Pixel 10 for Chromium, iPhone 17 for WebKit). Mobile pages are usually lighter, which saves tokens. Cannot be combined with --device.<br>*env* `PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_MOBILE` |
