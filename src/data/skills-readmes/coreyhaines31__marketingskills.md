## What are Skills?

Skills are markdown files that give AI agents specialized knowledge and workflows for specific tasks. When you add these to your project, your agent can recognize when you're working on a marketing task and apply the right frameworks and best practices.

## How Skills Work Together

Skills reference each other and build on shared context. The `product-marketing` skill is the foundation — every other skill checks it first to understand your product, audience, and positioning before doing anything.

## Installation

### Option 1: CLI Install (Recommended)

Use [npx skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) to install skills directly:

```bash
# Install all skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install specific skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --skill cro copywriting

# List available skills
npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills --list
```

The CLI detects which agents you have installed and asks where to install. For Claude Code it installs into `.claude/skills/`; universal agents share `.agents/skills/`.

> [!TIP]
> If you run the command from **inside** an agent session (e.g., asking Claude Code to install the skills for you), the CLI runs non-interactively and may only install to the universal `.agents/skills/` directory, which Claude Code does not read. Pass the agent explicitly:
>
> ```bash
> npx skills add coreyhaines31/marketingskills -a claude-code
> ```

### Option 2: Claude Code Plugin

Install via Claude Code's built-in plugin system:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add coreyhaines31/marketingskills

# Install all marketing skills
/plugin install marketing-skills
```

### Option 3: Clone and Copy

Clone the entire repo and copy the skills folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git
cp -r marketingskills/skills/* .agents/skills/
```

### Option 4: Git Submodule

Add as a submodule for easy updates:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/coreyhaines31/marketingskills.git .agents/marketingskills
```

Then reference skills from `.agents/marketingskills/skills/`.

### Option 5: Fork and Customize

1. Fork this re
