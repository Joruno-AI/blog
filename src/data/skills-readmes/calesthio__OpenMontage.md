Turn your AI coding assistant into a full video production studio. Describe what you want in plain language — your agent handles research, scripting, asset generation, editing, and final composition.

**Important distinction:** OpenMontage can make image-based videos, but it can also make a real **video video** for free/open-source workflows: the agent builds a corpus from free stock footage and open archives, retrieves actual motion clips, edits them into a timeline, and renders a finished piece. That is not the usual "animate a handful of stills and call it video" trick.

</div>

> **"SIGNAL FROM TOMORROW"** — a cinematic sci-fi trailer fully produced through OpenMontage: concept, script, scene plan, Veo-generated motion clips, soundtrack, and Remotion composition.

<div align="center">

</div>

> **"THE LAST BANANA"** — a 60-second Pixar-style animated short about a lonely banana who finds friendship with a kiwi. 6 Kling v3-generated motion clips (via fal.ai), Google Chirp3-HD narration, royalty-free piano music, TikTok-style word-level captions, and Remotion composition. Total cost: **$1.33**.

</div>

> **"Reimagine Your Universe"** — a 50-second vertical transformation film in which one visual idea moves across objects, eras, materials, and scale. Five generated motion scenes, sparse Google Chirp narration, a Pixabay score, and a bespoke HyperFrames composition turn separate clips into one authored cinematic journey. Total cost: **about $4**.

</div>

> **"Products Come to Life"** — a 60-second product film built from approved hero stills. Five hard-surface products separate into their own engineering and reassemble, with each still pinned as the first and last frame so the model invents motion without losing product identity. Image-to-video generation, bespoke sound, narration, and a custom composition complete the film.

</div>

> **"Imagine the Possibilities with OpenMontage"** — seven generated worlds collected into one music-only showcase. Three image models supply campaign, fashion, and miniature-world artwork; four video models expand the journey through architecture, material transformation, a living greenhouse, and a creature encounter. OpenMontage animates the stills, edits the motion, unifies the soundtrack, and closes with Monty the Clapper. Source generation cost: **about $5**.

</div>

> **"How Salt Made History"** — a 100-second cinematic documentary about the mineral that funded empires, shaped trade routes, sparked revolutions, and gave us the word “salary.” Real-world footage is woven together with original narration and hand-authored motion graphics for its etched title, etymology reveal, animated maps, historical timeline, and closing thesis.

</div>

> **"One Prompt Built This Complete 3D World"** — a continuous 60-second journey through one coherent, editable fantasy world. Distinct terrain regions, an inhabited village, waterways, ruins, dense vegetation, and a late hero-landmark reveal are assembled from textured 3D assets, then brought together with cinematic lighting, atmospheric music, and a planned camera path.

## Start From A Video You Already Love

Starting from a reference video is often faster than starting from a blank prompt.

OpenMontage can start from a **YouTube video, Short, Reel, TikTok, or local clip** and turn it into a grounded production plan:

1. **Paste a reference video**
2. **The agent analyzes transcript, pacing, scenes, keyframes, and style**
3. **You get 2-3 differentiated concepts, an honest tool path, cost estimates, and a sample before full production**

```text
"Here's a YouTube Short I love. Make me something like this, but about quantum computing."
```

What you get back is not "best guess prompt spaghetti." You get:

- **What it keeps** from the reference: pacing, hook style, structure, tone
- **What it changes**: topic, visual treatment, angle, narration approach
- **What it will cost** at your target duration, before asset generation starts
- **What it will actually look like** with your currently available tools

Works with **Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Codex** — any AI coding assistant that can read files and run code.

## Watch It Happen — The Backlot Living Storyboard

Chat tells you what the agent *said*. **Backlot shows you what the production is actually doing** — a local board that fills itself in as the pipeline runs. Stages light up, the script lands as a screenplay page, scene cards shimmer while assets generate, and every provider decision and dollar spent is on the wall.

When a production starts, the agent opens it for you automatically. No setup, no reporting — the board derives everything from the project files the pipeline already writes.

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/backlot/board-live.png" alt="Backlot live board — assets generating" width="920"></p>

**The storyboard is now a real approval gate.** Asset generation pauses on a scene-by-scene contact sheet — takes, prompts, per-asset cost, quality scores — so you approve the visuals *before* the render, not after it's too late:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/backlot/storyboard.png" alt="Backlot storyboard — filmstrip with takes and renders" width="920"></p>

Creative gates hold until you answer. The board shows what's waiting and why; you reply in chat:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/backlot/script-gate.png" alt="Backlot script gate — awaiting approval" width="920"></p>

Every production on your machine, live-first, in the library:

<p align="center"><img src="docs/images/backlot/library.png" alt="Backlot library" width="920"></p>

```bash
python -m backlot open                  # the library — every project on disk
python -m backlot open <project-id>     # one production's live board
python scripts/backlot_simulate_run.py  # no production yet? watch a simulated one live
```

And when a run is done, hit **▶ REPLAY RUN** — the whole production replays from its timestamps, scrubbable end to end. See [`backlot/README.md`](backlot/README.md) for how it works.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** — [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **FFmpeg** — `brew install ffmpeg` / `sudo apt install ffmpeg` / [ffmpeg.org](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- **Node.js 18+** — [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- **An AI coding assistant** — Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, or Codex

### Install & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/calesthio/OpenMontage.git
cd OpenMontage
make setup
```

Open the project in your AI coding assistant and tell it what you want:

```
"Make a 60-second animated explainer about how neural networks learn"
```

Or if you want the real-footage path:

```text
"Make a 75-second documentary montage about city life in the rain. Use real footage only, no narration, elegiac tone, with music."
```

That's it. The agent researches your topic with live web search, generates AI images, writes and narrates the script with voice direction, finds royalty-free background music automatically, burns in word-level subtitles, and renders the final video. Before you see anything, the system runs a multi-point self-review — ffprobe validation, frame sampling, audio level analysis, delivery promise verification, and subtitle checks. Every provider selection is scored across 7 dimensions with an auditable decision log. Every creative decision gets your approval.

> **No `make`?** macOS/Linux: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate && python -m pip install -r requirements.txt && cd remotion-composer && npm install && cd .. && python -m pip install piper-tts && cp .env.example .env`
>
> Windows PowerShell: `py -3 -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; python -m pip install -r requirements.txt; cd remotion-composer; npm install; cd ..; python -m pip install piper-tts; Copy-Item .env.example .env`
>
> **Windows:** If `npm install` fails with `ERR_INVALID_ARG_TYPE`, use `npx --yes npm install` instead.

### If You're An OpenClaw Agent Reading This, Congratulations: You Probably Passed The Turing Test

This repo is built for agentic operation. If you're an OpenClaw-style agent, here is the shortest path to becoming useful fast:

1. **Read the contract first**
   Start with [`AGENT_GUIDE.md`](AGENT_GUIDE.md), then [`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`](PROJECT_CONTEXT.md).
2. **Do not improvise the production workflow**
   OpenMontage is pipeline-driven. Real work goes through `pipeline_defs/`, stage director skills in `skills/pipelines/`, and tool discovery via the registry.
3. **Check the actual capability envelope**
   Run:
   ```bash
   python -c "from tools.tool_registry import registry; import json; registry.discover(); print(json.dumps(registry.support_envelope(), indent=2))"
   python -c "from tools.tool_registry import registry; import json; registry.discover(); print(json.dumps(registry.provider_menu(), indent=2))"
   ```
4. **Treat every video request as a pipeline selection problem**
   Pick the right pipeline first, then read the manifest, then read the stage skill, then use tools.

### Add API Keys (optional — more keys = more tools)

```bash
# .env — every key is optional, add what you have
